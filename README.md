# Timemap Visualization (TMVis)

<img src="tmvis-main-page.png" width="500">

TMVis was a research project that provided visualizations of how individual webpages have changed over time. We developed four visualizations: Image Grid, Image Slider, Timeline, and Animated GIF. The code is available (without support) in this repository. We previously had a live demo site, but that is no longer available.

See <https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/tmvis-embed/> for examples of embedding the Image Grid, Image Slider, and Animated GIF in a webpage.

For more details, see [Visualizing Webpage Changes Over Time With TMVis](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2020/05/2020-05-21-visualizing-webpage-changes.html) from May 2020 on the [ODU WS-DL Blog](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/).

This work was supported by a [NEH/IMLS Digital Humanities Advancement Grant](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2017/10/2017-10-16-visualizing-webpage-changes.html) ([HAA-256368-17](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HAA-256368-17)). We are grateful for the support of [NEH](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh) and [IMLS](https://www.imls.gov), and for the input from our partners, Deborah Kempe and Sumitra Duncan from the [Frick Art Reference Library](https://www.frick.org/research/library) and [New York Art Resources Consortium](http://www.nyarc.org/) and Pamela Graham and Alex Thurman from [Columbia University Libraries](https://library.columbia.edu/). This project is an extension of AlSum and Nelson’s ECIR 2014 work, [“Thumbnail Summarization Techniques for Web Archives”](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/pubs/ecir-2014/ecir-2014.pdf), and Mat Kelly's ([@machawk1](https://github.com/machawk1)) [ArchiveThumbnails project](https://github.com/machawk1/ArchiveThumbnails), funded by an incentive grant from Columbia University Libraries and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

## Running as a Docker Container

Running the server in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container can make the process of dependency management easier. This document assumes that you have Docker setup already, if not then follow the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

A Docker image from the current version of the code is built and published on Docker Hub at [oduwsdl/tmvis](https://hub.docker.com/r/oduwsdl/tmvis). Pull the image and run the service in a container as shown below:

```
$ docker pull oduwsdl/tmvis
$ docker run --shm-size=1G -it --rm -p 3000:3000 oduwsdl/tmvis
```
Alternatively, a custom Docker image can be built from the source. In order to do this, clone the repository and change the working directory then build and run the image as the following:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/oduwsdl/tmvis.git
$ cd tmvis
$ docker image build -t timemapvis .
$ docker run --shm-size=1G -it --rm -p 3000:3000 timemapvis
```


In the above command the container is running and can be accessed from outside on port `3000` at http://localhost:3000/. If you want to run the service on a different port, say `80` then change `-p 3000:3000` to `-p 80:3000`.

In order to persist generated thumbnails, mount a host directory as a volume inside the container by adding `-v /SOME/HOST/DIRECTORY:/app/assets/screenshots` flag when running the container.

Container is completely transparent from the outside and it will be accessed as if the service is running in the host machine itself.

In case if you want to make changes in the `tmvis` code itself, you might want to run it in the development mode by mounting the code from the host machine inside the container so that changes are reflected immediately, without requiring an image rebuild. Use the following command to mount the code from the host:
```
$ docker run --shm-size=1G -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app -v /app/node_modules -p 3000:3000 timemapvis
```


## Running Locally

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required to run the service. In order to run this program locally, clone the repository and change the working directory then install dependencies and run the server file as the following:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/oduwsdl/tmvis.git
$ cd tmvis
$ npm install -g
$ node tmvis.js
```

## Usage of the service

Running this service provides a user with the array of JSON object as the response (webservice model), which then has to be visualized with the UI tool, whose source code is available here under the [public folder](https://github.com/oduwsdl/tmvis/tree/main/public).

Supported server arguments are as follows:
- `host` is used to specify server's hostname, default `localhost`
- `port` is used to specify server's port, default `3000`
- `proxy` is used to specify proxy, generated using `host` and `port` if not provided
- `debug` is used to add logs to server's console, useful for development
- `ssd` is used to specify the amount of time to wait before taking a screenshot of a memento in seconds, default `2`
- `oes` overrides the usage of cache files, default `false`
- `os` computes both simhash and hamming distance, default `true`
- `maxMementos` is used to specify the maximum number of mementos to be analyzed, default `1000`

To query the server instance generated using your browser visit `http://localhost:3000/alsummarizedtimemap/archiveIt/1068/4/[histogram | stats | summary]/[from]/[to]/http://4genderjustice.org/`, which has the attributes path as `primesource/ci/role/from/to/URI-R` substitute the URI-R to request a different site's summarization.

### Parameter Definitions:
- `primesource` gets the value of 'archiveit', 'arquivopt', or 'internetarchive' as to let the service know which is the primary source.
- `ci` is used to specify the collection identifier if not specified the argument 'all' is used
- `role`: This is used to specify the values 'histogram', 'stats' or 'summary'.
    - histogram: to get dates and times of a timemap in the specified date range.
    - stats: for getting the no of unique mementos.
    - summary: to get the the unique mementos along with the screenshots captured.
- `from` and `to`: These parameters are used to specify the date range of the timemap to be loaded (`/0/0/` for full timemap or `/YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD` format for a specific date range).
